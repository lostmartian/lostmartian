  Logical problem solving has always appealed to me and this explains my interests in mathematics, programming and computing in general. 
</p>

<p align='center'>
  I have been doing competitive programming over the past one year and have come across different data structures and algorithms and have been very well equiped with those.
</p>

<p align='center'>
  Recently I have been exploring QT frameworks for cross platform software development using C++ and also trying to get a good grasp on Web development using MERN stack.

  Apart from coding you will find me doing sketching, binge-watching Web series, chilling with friends or shopping.
